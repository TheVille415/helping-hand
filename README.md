### Who We Are - can insert emojis later? -
- We started this journey with one goal: to help our communities.

## An App built to help you serve the community in any way you want 

With the rise of more and more injusties in our communites, we wanted to develop and app that put some of the power back in our own hands.

We designed Helping Hand to connect volunteers and professionals to people in the surrounding areas who are seeking help.

## Getting Started

## Option 1

### Using our app with TestFlight

First make sure you have installed the proper apps installed. To run out app make sure you have TestFlight installed on your iOS device. If you dont we have a link to it [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664).

### App Link

## Option 2

### Using our app with Expo

First make sure you have Expo Go installed on your iOS device by clicking the link [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)

### App Link

If you want to run Helping Hand on Expo make sure to click the link [here](https://expo.dev/@merissab44/helping-hand). You should then be able to access the app by opening it on your iPhone.

### App Status

Currently our app only has basic navigation and a static map feed as of 10/15/21. We are publishign our app to TestFlight but that came with more hurdles that anticipated. For our next steps we are planning to make our pages gather the data and save each profile whether it be a user or a volunteer.
