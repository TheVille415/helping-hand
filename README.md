## An App built to help you serve the community in any way you want 

With the rise of more and more injusties in our communites, we wanted to develop and app that put some of the power back in our own hands.

We designed Helping Hand to connect volunteers and professionals to people in the surrounding areas who are seeking help.

## Getting Started

### App Status

Currently our app only has basic navigation and a static map feed as of 10/15/21. Our pages will soon be able to gather the data and save each profile wether it be a user or a volunteer.
