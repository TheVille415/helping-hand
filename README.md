### We started this journey with one goal: to help our communities.

## An App built to help you serve the community in any way you want 

With the rise of more and more injustices in our communities, we wanted to develop an app that put some of the power back in our own hands.

We designed Helping Hand to connect volunteers and professionals to people in the surrounding areas who are seeking help.

## Getting Started

### Using our app with Expo on your local device

First clone our repo by using 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/TheVille415/helping-hand.git
```
Then make sure you have Expo and Xcode installed on your local device. 
If you don't have either installed you can install them by clicking these links:

Expo Download [here](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

Xcode Downlaod [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

### Running the app
Once you have expo installed and our repo downloaded you can run these commands to install the needed dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
After that's done to start the app run
```
$ npm start
```
The will open the app in a new tab or window with Expo, this is when you will click on 'Run on iOS simulator'

### App Status

As of 7/12/21, we have made some large updates! We now have a working frontend for both users and volunteers. We have also implemented our complete onboarding flow for new users. We have added functionality for firebase to connect to our backend and we have an initial implementation of WebSockets.

Our next steps are to work on the further implementation of our Firebase backend. This will allow us to get a smoother working sign-in and sign-out page. We also are going to push on populating our population with our dynamic request management system via WebSockets.
